# Training-cmd-app
This project has two intentions, a motivation to learn to program, and a tool for working out.

For each specific excercise I registered by hand in excel sheets the time it would take me to rest, recover and be ready for another set of the same amount of reps.
Depending on the amount of reps I did and the averages I took, it tells me how much I should rest, It then prompts the countdown and when finished plays a song so I can go for another set (it asks).

So, it starts by asking what exercise I want to do, then asks what set is the one I'm about to do (added that for )
