# Training-cmd-app
This project has two intentions, a motivation to learn to program, and a tool for working out.

For each specific excercise I registered by hand in excel sheets the time it would take me to rest, recover and be ready for another set of the same amount of reps.
Depending on the amount of reps I did and the averages I took it tells me how much I should rest, prints a countdown and when finished plays a song and asks if I want to go for another set.

So, it starts by asking what exercise I want to do, then asks what set I'm about to do (added that  because there were times I would accidentaly close in the middle of a workout session).

It also collects data from the session and saves it in .csv files.
